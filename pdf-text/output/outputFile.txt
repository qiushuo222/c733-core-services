Daniel Vieira,Gabriela Calistro Rivera,Laura N. Mart z∼3.4 submillimeter galaxy SMM J13120+4242, using multi-conﬁguration observations with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA). The gas reservoir, imaged on 0.39” (∼3 kpc) scales, is resolved into two components separated by ∼11 kpc with a total extent of 16 ± 3 kpc. Despite the large spatial extent of the reservoir, the observations show a CO(1-0) FWHM linewidth of only 267 ± 64 km s We derive a revised line luminosity of L= (10 ± 3) × 10 mass of M= (13 ± 3) × 10(α/1) M. Despite the presence of a velocity gradient (consistent with previous resolved CO(6-5) imaging), the CO(1-0) imaging shows evidence for signiﬁcant turbulent motions which are preventing the gas from fully settling into a disk. The system likely represents a merger in an advanced stage. Although the dynamical mass is highly uncertain, we use it to place an upper limit on the CO–to–Hmass conversion factor α that this galaxy lies on the very massive end of the main sequence at z=3.4. Based on the low gas fraction, short gas depletion time and evidence for a central AGN, we propose that SMM J13120 is in a rapid transitional phase between a merger-driven starburst and an unobscured quasar. The case of SMM J13120 highlights the how mergers may drive important physical changes in galaxies without pushing them oﬀ the main sequence.

The evolution of the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD) has now been well characterised as far back as the epoch of reionisation. It increased from the early stages of the Universe until it peaked at z = 1 − 3, and then decreased until the present day (Madau & Dickinson 2014). Parallel to these optical and near-IR studies, powerful radio and submillimeter interferometers such as the Karl G. Jansky Very large Array (VLA), the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) or the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) have enabled the ﬁrst deep blind emission line surveys (ASPECS, at z∼ 1 − 4, Walter et al. 2016, COLDz, at z ∼ 2.5 − 6, Pavesi et al. 2018). These have begun to unveil the evolution of the cosmic molecular gas mass density out to z ∼ 6, revealing a very good agreement with the cosmic SFRD. Along with progress in state-ofthe-art hydrodynamical simulations (e.g., SIMBA, Dav´e et al. 2019; IllustrisTNG, Diemer et al. 2019; Popping et al. 2019), these studies add to the growing consensus that the molecular gas reservoirs of galaxies are key drivers of the observed cosmic SFRD evolution, rather than changes in star forming eﬃciency (Scoville et al. 2016; Tacconi et al. 2018; Riechers et al. 2019; Decarli et al. 2020; Walter et al. 2020). Understanding the molecular gas properties of galaxies over cosmic time is therefore crucial for obtaining a complete picture of how galaxies form and evolve (Kennicutt & Evans 2012; Carilli & Walter 2013; Hodge & da Cunha 2020; Tacconi et al. 2020).
---------------------
CO (hereafter CO), the second most abundant molecule in galaxies after molecular hydrogen (H), has been traditionally used to trace the total molecular gas content of galaxies. The low excitation temperature T = 5.5 K of the rotational ground state (J = 1 − 0) of CO means that this molecule is easily excited in a variety of galactic environments, tracing the bulk of the cold molecular gas. The CO(1-0) luminosity can be directly related to the cold molecular gas mass via a conversion factor α(see Bolatto et al. 2013, for a review). Due to the intrinsic faintness of the line and the great distances involved, large time investments are needed to detect this transition at high redshift, so mid- and highJ CO transitions such as J = 4 − 3 and J = 6 − 5 are often used instead. These transitions trace denser, actively star-forming gas, and are typically brighter and thus easier to detect than the ground state transition. Relating their line luminosities to the CO(1-0) line luminosity, however, requires additional assumptions about line excitation, with conversion factors spanning a wide range of values over the high-z galaxy population (Carilli & Walter 2013; Narayanan & Krumholz 2014; Sharon et al. 2016; Yang et al. 2017; Riechers et al. 2020). Furthermore, higher-J CO transitions have been shown to miss a signiﬁcant fraction of the lower-excitation gas, and might therefore not be representative of the total molecular gas content of the galaxies. This would in turn lead to an underestimation of the dynamical mass and gas fraction, among other properties (Ivison et al. 2011; Riechers et al. 2011; Ca˜nameras et al. 2018).
---------------------
Submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) are one of the main sites of star formation in the high-z Universe (Casey et al. 2014; Hodge & da Cunha 2020). These dusty, high infrared luminosity (L> 10L; Magnelli et al. 2012a) systems are found predominantly at high redshift (Chapman et al. 2005; Danielson et al. 2017). They have star formation rates up to, and even in excess of, ∼ 1000 Myr, fed by large molecular gas reservoirs of 10M(Greve et al. 2005; Tacconi et al. 2008; Bothwell et al. 2013; Birkin et al. 2021). Such intense starburst episodes are thought to be mainly triggered by major mergers, interactions with neighbouring galaxies or through accretion of cold gas from the intergalactic medium. Obtaining a clear picture of the physical conditions and structure of their interstellar medium (ISM), as well as the processes regulating their star formation, is critical to our understanding of the history of cosmic star formation. However, despite their extreme properties, resolved studies of the low-J CO emission in highredshift SMGs on kpc/sub-kpc scales remain a technical challenge, even for the few extremely bright (e.g., GN20, Hodge et al. 2012) and/or strongly lensed systems (e.g., HLSJ091828.6+514223; Rawle et al. 2014; SDSS J0901+1814; Sharon et al. 2019) in which they have been carried out. In this paper we extend these to SMM J13120+4242 (hereafter SMM J13120).
---------------------
SMM J13120 is a z = 3.4, non-lensed SMG that was ﬁrst detected in the Hawaii Deep Field SSA 13. This SMG has an active galactic nucleus (AGN), revealed by optical emission lines (Si IV, C IV, O III, Chapman et al. 2005), point-like X-ray imaging (Wang et al. 2016) and the need to include an AGN component to accurately ﬁt the SED (Section 3). CO(1-0) observations with the GBT by Hainline et al. (2006) originally suggested a very broad line of FWHM ∼ 1000 km s, implying an ongoing merger. This scenario was further supported by resolved observations of CO(6-5) showing a disturbed structure and velocity distribution (Engel et al. 2010). Subsequent CO(1-0) imaging with the VLA revealed a very massive (M= 1.9-6.9×10M), extended (15 kpc) low excitation gas reservoir (Riechers et al. 2011, hereafter R11). In this work we present high-resolution (0.39”) JVLA CO(1-0) imaging of J13120, spatially and kinematically resolving the cold molecular gas reservoir in this unlensed galaxy.
---------------------
This paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we describe the observations and data reduction. The main results are presented in Section 3, where we include a reevaluation of the evidence for a broad CO(10) linewidth, source size estimation and revisit the SED ﬁtting. In Section 4 we present the analysis of this data, including estimates of the gas fraction and gas depletion time (Section 4.1), the dynamical mass and CO-to-H conversion factor (Section 4.2) and the revised gas excitation modeling (Section 4.3). In Section 5 we place the extended gas reservoir seen in SMM J13120 in context with the literature (Section 5.1) and we further discuss the fate of this galaxy given the analysis presented here (Section 5.2). We end with our conclusion in Section 6.
---------------------
A cosmology of H= 67.4 km sMpc, Ω= 0.315, and Ω= 0.685 is assumed throughout this paper (Planck Collaboration et al. 2020). At a redshift of z = 3.408, this corresponds to an angular scale of 7.56 kpc arcsecand a luminosity distance of 30.3 Gpc.
---------------------
We used the JVLA to observe the CO(J = 1-0) emission (rest-frame frequency: ν= 115.27 GHz) from SMM J13120 (VLA program ID: 15A-405 and 17B-108, PI: Hodge). At z = 3.408, the line is redshifted to 26.15 GHz. We used the K band receivers in combination with the WIDAR correlator conﬁgured to 8 bit sampling mode to observe a contiguous bandwidth of 2.048 GHz (full polarization) covering the 24.446 - 26.342 GHz frequency range at 2 MHz spectral resolution (23 km s at 26.15 GHz). Four of the allocated 50 hours were observed in 2015 March (B conﬁguration). The remaining 46 hrs were observed between 2018 October and December (B and C conﬁgurations). In total, 39.9 hours were spent in B conﬁguration and 9.96 hours in C conﬁguration. The data were combined with previous observations taken between 2010 May (C and D conﬁgurations) and 2011 January (CnB conﬁguration) (Program ID: AR708, PI: Riechers). This resulted in a combined integration time of 57.6 hrs. After accounting for calibration overheads and ﬂagging, the total on-source integration time was 30.9 hrs.
---------------------
The quasar 3C 286 was used to determine the absolute ﬂux density and for bandpass calibration. The VLA calibrator J1242+3751 was observed every 3.5 minutes for phase and amplitude calibration. Observations were taken in full polarization mode.
---------------------
All data was reduced using the Common Astronomy Software Application (CASA) package version 5.6.0-60 (McMullin et al. 2007). Several antennas and two spectral windows were manually ﬂagged after inspecting the calibration output. In K-band, the largest angular scale is 7.9” (59.5 kpc at z∼3.4) for B conﬁguration and 66” (497.6 kpc) for C and D conﬁgurations at 22GHz, the center of the band.
---------------------
We imaged the data using the CLEAN algorithm, and cleaned down to 2σ in a 5.0” × 4.3” clean box around SMM J13120+4242. We used natural weighting, which resulted in a synthesised beam FWHM of 0.39” × 0.34” at a PA = -81. We further performed synthesis imaging of the data using the multi-scale version of the WS-Clean algorithm introduced by Oﬀringa et al. (2014); Oﬀringa & Smirnov (2017), but found no quantitative or qualitative improvement over the imaging performed with CASA. The resulting rms value achieved was 27.2 µJy beamchannel, with channels of width 46 km s. At a tapered resolution of 0.9”, we achieve an rms of 35 µJy beamchannel, in comparison to the 70 µJy beamchanneldepth of R11 for an equal channel width and spatial resolution.
---------------------
Observations of the CO J = 6-5 transition were carried out in winter 2007/2008 with the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer in the extended A conﬁguration. At z=3.4, the CO(6-5) transition is redshifted into the 2mm band. The data were presented in Engel et al. (2010). We reuse the imaging products created in the MAPPING environment of GILDAS (Engel, Davies, priv.comm.). The rms value is 0.64 mJy beam channel(channel width of 20 km s), with a beam size of 0.59” × 0.47” at a P.A. = 50.9.
---------------------
The CO(1-0) spectrum of SMM J13120 is shown in Fig. 1. The spectrum was extracted using a circular aperture of 1.75” diameter centered on the source, chosen to maximise the recovered ﬂux. We ﬁt the line with a single Gaussian proﬁle that yields a peak ﬂux density of 0.67 ± 0.14 mJy, with a FWHM of 267 ± 64 km s and integrated ﬂux of 0.19 ± 0.06 Jy km s. The line is consistent with the central peak that was detected

The solid line shows the Gaussian ﬁt to the data, which yields a peak ﬂux density of 0.67 ± 0.14 mJy and a FWHM of 267 ± 64 km s. at a 4σ level in the earlier VLA observations by R11 (see their Figure 2, bottom), which we use as our short spacings here.
---------------------
Channel maps of 46 km swidth are shown in Figure 2. Emission ﬁrst appears at 131 km s, and disappears at -283 km s. The data cube was tapered to 0.6” and 0.9” to search for additional extended emission that might be resolved out at native resolution (see Appendix), but no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in total ﬂux density was found.
---------------------
Ancillary data for SMM J13120 previously suggested a broader CO line FWHM. Greve et al. (2005) detected unresolved CO(4–3) emission with PdBI with a velocity width of 530 ± 50 km s. Engel et al. (2010) reported a broad ∼900 km sFWHM for the CO(6-5) emission. Upon examination of the CO(6-5) data cube (Engel et al. 2010, priv. comm.; see Figure 7.), we found that the SNR of the data and the narrow total bandwidth of the cube (1800 km s) does not allow a robust continuum subtraction, so it is possible that continuum emission is causing an artiﬁcial widening of this line.
---------------------
The earlier spectra of SMM J13120 from the GBT (using the Autocorrelation Spectrometer; Hainline et al. 2006) and VLA (R11) appeared to show evidence for CO(1-0) emission as well across a broader, >1000 km svelocity range, albeit at limited SNR for both instruments. This naturally raises a question about whether the new high-resolution VLA data are missing more extended emission at large velocities, such as has been reported in some follow-up studies of high-redshift sources

Riechers et al. (2011) Engel et al. (2010) with the GBT (e.g., Frayer et al. 2018). However, the new data disfavour the presence of such a broad component at a ﬂux level consistent with the uncertainties on the earlier VLA data (see Appendix). Moreover, despite the two times improved sensitivity of the combined dataset even when tapering to the resolution of the initial data set, we do not ﬁnd evidence for emission above 2σ signiﬁcance beyond the central emission component. We note that, despite the narrow linewidth we ﬁnd here, we still ﬁnd evidence for a spatially extended CO(10) reservoir (Section 3.2) and a diﬀuse low-excitation gas component (Section 4.3). A deep integration with a single-dish telescope would be required to investigate if an even lower surface brightness extended component is present in this source.
---------------------
The task IMMOMENTS in CASA was used to obtain the integrated-intensity map (moment 0) and intensityweighted velocity ﬁeld (moment 1). Both moment maps were extracted by collapsing the data cube over the channels where emission is present, and the moment 1 map was further clipped at 2 times the rms noise per channel. The maps are shown in Figure 3. The moment 0 map reveals a source elongated in the SE to NW direction, at a PA of 127. We detect two diﬀerent components separated by 1.5” (∼11 kpc). The central

The secondary (NW) component is located at ∆RA = -0.125” (-0.9kpc) and ∆Dec = 0.4” (3kpc) with respect to the main component.
---------------------
The moment 1 map shows a complex velocity ﬁeld, with most of the emission arising at the systemic velocity. There is no apparent structure in the velocity ﬁeld of the NW component. No signiﬁcant emission is seen outside this velocity range, which is consistent with the line proﬁle discussed below. We do not detect any rest-frame 2.6mm continuum emission from either component down to a 3σ limit of 10.6 µJy beam.
---------------------
We ﬁt a 2D Gaussian to the 0th moment map using the task IMFIT in CASA, ﬁnding a deconvolved size of 2.1 ± 0.5” × 1.0 ± 0.2” (16 ± 3 × 8 ± 2 kpc). For the two spatially resolved components seen in the moment 1 map, we ﬁnd a size of 1.3 ± 0.3” × 0.7 ± 0.2” (10 ± 2 × 5 ± 1 kpc) and 0.6 ± 0.2” × 0.3 ± 0.2” (5 ± 1 × 2 ± 2 kpc) for the central and the NW component respectively.
---------------------
We further derived the size of the molecular gas reservoir from the uv-data directly to avoid possible biases introduced by the imaging process. We extract the vis-

The 1st moment map was clipped at 2 times the rms noise per channel (σ = 9 µJy beam), and contours are shown in steps of 50 km s. We ﬁt a 2D elliptical Gaussian to the 0th moment map to determine the peak position of the emission, shown by the cross, corresponding to the white cross in Fig. 2. ibilities corresponding to the channels within the full width at zero intensity of the line from the cube. We then average the data in radial bins of 15 kλ and ﬁt a Gaussian proﬁle to the data, as shown in Figure 4. The resulting half-light radius is 1.20 ± 0.15 ” (9.1 ± 1.1 kpc), consistent with our estimation from the moment 0 map ﬁtting. At 150kλ there is tentative evidence which may indicate the presence of unresolved structure not captured by our Gaussian model.

In order to perform a consistent analysis of SMM J13120, we re-examine the physical properties of the

Although previous estimates were reported in the literature (Hainline et al. 2006; Micha lowski et al. 2010), we have included new photometric data available from the radio to the Xrays (see Table 2). In particular, a Chandra detection of this source (Wang et al. 2016) reported an X-ray luminosity of log(L) ∼ 44, associated with an AGN (an unphysical SFR ∼ 10Myrwould be required to explain this emission from star formation, according to the L-SFR relation by Mineo et al. 2014), which is furthermore supported by emission line properties characteristic of AGN (Chapman et al. 2005).
---------------------
To account for the contribution of the AGN to the multi-wavelength SED we use the most recent version of the MCMC-based code AGNﬁtter (Calistro Rivera et al. 2016). Given the unique data coverage for this source, we use the updated version of the code, AGNﬁtter-rX (Martinez-Ramirez in prep.), which is the ﬁrst Bayesian SED-ﬁtting routine which consistently models the SEDs of the host galaxy and the AGN emission, from the radio to the X-rays. The AGNﬁtter model we used here consists of six diﬀerent physical components: the Xray corona, the accretion disk emission (Richards et al. 2006), the hot dust torus emission (Stalevski et al. 2016), the stellar populations (Bruzual & Charlot 2003, with a Chabrier IMF and exponentially declining starformation history), the cooler dust heated by star formation (Schreiber et al. 2016), and the radio emission component (see Figure 5). Our SED modelling approach yields a SFR=948Myrand a stellar mass of log M[M] = 11.81. These estimates differ from those reported in the literature: Hainline (2008) found log(M) = 10.96±0.04 and SFR=890 Myr; whereas Micha lowski et al. (2010) found log(M)=11.36 (no uncertainties were reported) and 3700 Myr. The advantage of the new estimates lies on the improved modelling approach used, and the inclusion of the most recent additional data points in the ﬁt (HSTWFC3 F160W and Chandra). Several tests were completed to assess the robustness of the derived values. Included within these were the use of restrictive and ﬂexible energy balance (in which the luminosity of the cold dust is equal or allowed to be greater than the total luminosity attenuated by dust, respectively), setting the AGN component to 0 and deactivating all the priors. All the tests which allow an AGN component return stellar masses agreeing within the error bars. We note that the stellar masses inferred were not directly aﬀected by the AGN component but rather by the additional photometric data points and diﬀerent SFH models chosen. For the SFR, our estimate is consistent with the Hainline et al. (2006) estimate, while it diﬀers from Micha lowski et al. (2010), which predicts an extremely large value that may be unrealistic given SMG statistics (da Cunha et al. 2015). We note that a further signiﬁcant advantage of the current method is its probabilistic Bayesian approach. The poor photometric coverage of the FIR-MIR SED directly translates into an uncertain SFR from the IR and an uncertain AGN torus contribution to the total IR emission (12%from our ﬁt), therefore highlighting the need of a Bayesian approach that robustly recovers the uncertainties of the inferred quantities. With these uncertainties in mind, these revised estimates place SMM J13120 on the massive end of the main sequence at z = 3.4 (using the deﬁnition from Speagle et al. 2014; see Hodge & da Cunha 2020 for a discussion of further systematic uncertainties).

---------------------
The line luminosity can be transformed into a molecular gas mass through the conversion factor:
---------------------
It is common to apply diﬀerent values for α, depending on the galaxy type (see Bolatto et al. 2013 for a review). Normal star-forming galaxies show the standard Milky Way value α= 4.3 MKkms pc, while studies of local ULIRGS and high redshift starburst galaxies often assume α= 0.8 MKkms pc. Theoretical studies have shown that the value of αdepends on a range of ISM conditions, such as metallicity and dust temperature (Narayanan et al. 2012; Magnelli et al. 2012b; Gong et al. 2020).
---------------------
There are a growing number of studies in high-z SMGs that point towards the use of α∼ 1 (e.g., Hodge et al. 2012; Calistro Rivera et al. 2018; Birkin et al. 2021; Riechers et al. 2021), so we adopt this value to estimate the molecular gas mass of SMM J13120 (as we show in Section 4.2, our data excludes α> 1.4). Multiplying by ×1.36 to account for Helium, we obtain M= (13 ± 3) × 10(α/1.0) M, a factor of two higher than

(2021) of M= (6.7 ± 0.5) × 10 M. Our gas mass estimate is also several times higher than those of the ALESS sample (Swinbank et al. 2013) and the compilation of more than 700 SMGs selected from the AS2UDS survey (Dudzeviˇci¯ut˙e et al. 2020), although we point out that these were derived from dust masses assuming a ﬁxed gas-to-dust ratio , δ, of 90 and 100, respectively, instead of CO observations.
---------------------
With our gas and stellar mass estimates, the resulting baryonic gas mass fraction is f= M/(M+ M) = 0.17 ± 0.03. This value is over a factor of two lower than the compilations of SMGs at z ∼ 2.8 - 3, which have a median f∼ 0.4 (Dudzeviˇci¯ut˙e et al. 2020), as well as other star forming galaxies at z ∼ 3.3 (Suzuki et al.
---------------------
2020) and main sequence galaxies at z ∼ 2.5 (Saintonge et al. 2013; Tacconi et al. 2018).
---------------------
Using our revised estimate of the total molecular gas reservoir and SFR, we can calculate the time that it would take for the system to deplete the current gas supply at its current SFR, t= 137 ± 69 (α/1) Myr. This indicates a phase of rapid star formation seen also in some other high-z SMGs and starburst galaxies (Tacconi et al. 2008; Hodge et al. 2013; Riechers et al. 2013; Aravena et al. 2016; Oteo et al. 2016; Nayyeri et al. 2017), or local ULIRGs (Solomon et al. 1997; Combes et al. 2013), and is shorter than the estimates for the average SMG population at this redshift (e.g., Birkin et al. 2021; Dudzeviˇci¯ut˙e et al. 2020) or predictions from simulations (McAlpine et al. 2019), which favour depletion timescales of the order of several hundred million

We extracted position-velocity (PV) diagrams of the CO(1-0) and CO(6-5) emission along an axis at PA = 47.3, chosen to maximise the observed velocity gradient. For comparison, the minor axis of the source has a PA = 37. The resulting CO(1-0) PV diagram is shown in Figure 6. A velocity gradient can be observed aligned with the minor axis of SMM J13120. In Fig. 7 we also show the PV diagram extracted from the CO(6-5) cube along the same axis as before. Despite the perturbed structure of the velocity ﬁeld seen in the CO(1-0) 1st moment map (Figure 3, bottom), a remarkably similar velocity gradient is present in both line transitions.
---------------------
We attempted to model the kinematics of SMM J13120 using the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo tools GaLPaK(Bouch´e et al. 2015) and qubeﬁt (mneeleman & Prochaska 2021). As noted above, however, the velocity gradient is aligned with the minor axis rather than the major axis. Together with the disturbed global morphology and limited SNR per channel, this precluded dynamically modelling the data as a rotating disk.
---------------------
Instead we estimate the enclosed dynamical mass of SMM J13120 within the half-light radius through the

The CO(6-5) emission shows evidence for a similar gradient as seen in CO(1-0). measured CO(1-0) linewidth. We adopt the virial estimator (Tacconi et al. 2008; Engel et al. 2010), which relates the linewidth, radii and mass of the system through the equation:
---------------------
M(< r) = 2.8 × 10∆vRM where ∆v is the line FWHM in km sand Ris the gas half-light radius in kpc. The scaling factor adopted assumes the gas to be dispersion dominated and is consistent with results derived from detailed Jeans modeling for high-z galaxies (Cappellari et al. 2009). We consider this assumption to be appropriate given the chaotic velocity ﬁeld in SMM J13120. We note that the scaling factor for a rotating disk at an average inclination would be a factor of ∼ 1.5 smaller. Taking the half-light radius as half of the semi-major axis FWHM (8 kpc, see Section 3), we derive a value of M= (1.6 ± 0.9) × 10M. This value is hard to reconcile with the stellar and gas mass estimates (6.45 × 10Mand 1.3 × 10 M, respectively), highlighting the highly uncertain nature of the dynamical mass estimate due to the clear presence of non-gravitationally supported motions. Evidence of this comes from our inability to dynamically model the system, which suggests the CO(1-0) is dominated by turbulent motions which prevent the gas from settling into a disk. Nevertheless, we can attempt to put constraints on the αconversion factor by taking the 2σ values of the quantities considered and assuming no dark matter. Taking the 2σ values of Mand
---------------------
M, 3.4×10and 1.5×10respectively, we ﬁnd α < 1.4. If we instead consider M= 2.5×10(+1σ), we ﬁnd α< 0.7. Even when making these liberal assumptions, we ﬁnd that αcannot be higher than 1.4, consistent with recent work on SMGs at high redshift (Calistro Rivera et al. 2018; Birkin et al. 2021). This supports the choice of a low, ULIRG-like αvalue as discussed in Section 4.1.
---------------------
We can build the CO SLED of SMM J13120 using the CO(4-3) and CO(6-5) line luminosities (Greve et al. 2005; Engel et al. 2010). We obtain line luminosity ratios of r= 0.56 ± 0.20 and r= 0.37 ± 0.12. Fig. 8, top, shows the CO SLED in comparison with high-redshift systems GN20 (Carilli et al. 2010) and the QSO Cloverleaf (Bradford et al. 2009). We also show the statistical SLEDs derived for high-z SMGs in Birkin et al. (2021) and for 1.4 mm-selected dusty star-forming galaxies in Spilker et al. (2014). The excitation in SMM J13120 agrees well with the general SMG population up to J = 4, with r= 0.32 ± 0.05, and displays a slightly higher excitation at J = 6, although still consistent with the average r= 0.3 ± 0.09 (Birkin et al. 2021).
---------------------
The shape of the CO SLED can give us information on the gas density and temperature distributions. Therefore, we redo the Large Velocity Gradient (LVG) modeling of R11 with the new CO(1-0) line ﬂux. We calculate the brightness temperatures for the observed CO transitions on a grid of kinetic temperature and Hdensity spanning 10-200 K and 10- 10cm. We ﬁx the Hortho-to-para ratio at 3:1 and set the CMB temperature to 12.03 K. We adopt a CO-Habundance ratio per velocity gradient of 1 × 10pc (km s)and use the Flower (2001) CO collision rates. We then convert the Rayleigh-Jeans temperature to line intensities and run an MCMC code to obtain the optimal values with uncertainties for the gas kinetic temperature, Hdensity and source ﬁlling factor. We ﬁnd that the data is well ﬁt by a two-component LVG model, represented by a diﬀuse, low-excitation component with a kinetic temperature of T= 25±5 K and a gas density of ρ= 10cm, and a high-excitation component with T= 40±5 K and ρ= 10cm(comparable to the dust temperature of 40 K found by Kov´acs et al. 2006). Despite the signiﬁcantly revised CO(1-0)

(2014, green squares). The grey shadowed area represents the scatter of the Birkin et al. (2021) sample, which decreases at higher-J due to the limited number of data points. Also shown for comparison are the SMG GN20 (blue stars, Hodge et al. 2012) and the QSO Cloverleaf (magenta diamonds, Bradford et al. 2009). Bottom: CO excitation ladder (data points) and LVG model (solid line) for SMM J13120. The CO(J=4-3) and CO(6-5) data points are taken from Greve et al. (2005) and Engel et al. (2010), respectively. The best ﬁt to the data is a two-component LVG model (blue line) represented by a diﬀuse, low-excitation component with a kinetic temperature of T= 25±5 K and a gas density of ρ= 10cm(magenta line), and a high-excitation component with T= 40±5 K and ρ= 10cm(yellow line). luminosity and linewidth, these parameters are almost identical to those found by R11, with the only diﬀerence being the density of the warm component, where we ﬁnd 10cmcompared to 10cmin R11.
---------------------
CO lines from levels higher than J=2 are poor tracers of the total molecular gas content in galaxies due to their excitation requirements. Some studies of SMGs (including SMM J13120) have found evidence for very extended CO(1-0) reservoirs and/or broad linewidths in some cases (Ivison et al. 2011, R11) which are not observed in the higher-J CO transitions. Meanwhile, observations sensitive to low-surface-brightness emission on even larger angular scales have uncovered such massive gas reservoirs with radii of tens of kiloparsecs in a range of systems at high-z, from the Spiderweb Galaxy (Emonts et al. 2016) to dusty star forming galaxies and hyper-LIRGs (Frayer et al. 2018; Emonts et al. 2019). These studies suggest the existence of a diﬀuse, low excitation gas component that is not apparent from mid/high-J observations.
---------------------
Despite its narrow linewidth, the total cold gas reservoir inferred from the CO(1-0) emission in SMM J13120 has a mass of (13 ± 3) × 10M, and is extended over ∼16 kpc in diameter. Although the revised CO(1-0) luminosity is signiﬁcantly lower than previous estimates (R11), we additionally ﬁnd that the CO SLED still suggests the presence of two gas components to account for all the recovered CO(1-0) emission, including a diﬀuse component with T= 25±5 K and a warmer, denser component with T= 40±5 K. These ﬁndings are in line with other studies of high-z systems with available low-J CO detections (see e.g., Ivison et al. 2011; Riechers et al. 2011; Hodge et al. 2013, for unlensed galaxies, and Yang et al. 2017; Ca˜nameras et al. 2018; Harrington et al. 2020, for lensed sources), reinforcing the importance of low-J CO observations for establishing the nature of the molecular gas reservoirs in high-z systems and their role in early galaxy evolution.
---------------------
Due to the diﬃculty of detecting and spatially resolving CO(1-0) at high redshift, there are few other resolved observations of low-J CO transitions in SMGs in the literature. The most direct comparison can be made with GN20 (Carilli et al. 2010; Hodge et al. 2012, 2015), an unlensed, z = 4.05 SMG, and the only other such source with kpc-scale low-J CO imaging. In particular, extensive high-resolution (0.2/1.3∼kpc) observations with the JVLA in CO(2-1) revealed a clumpy, almost equallyextended cold molecular gas reservoir (∼14 kpc in diameter; Hodge et al. 2012). However, contrary to the study presented here, a dynamical analysis of GN20 found evidence of ordered disk rotation. We note that wet mergers have been shown to rapidly relax into smoothly rotating disks and/or be observationally indistinguishable from rotationally supported disks (e.g., Robertson et al. 2006; Robertson & Bullock 2008; Bournaud et al. 2009) and thus the presence of ordered rotation alone does not automatically preclude a major merger origin. Nevertheless, the present high-resolution CO(1-0) observations of SMM J13120 stand in stark contrast to the disk-like rotation revealed by the high-resolution CO(21) imaging of GN20, implying that we may have caught SMM J13120 in a distinct and potentially short-lived evolutionary stage, as discussed further in the following Section.
---------------------
With the wealth of data available for SMM J13120, we are now able to speculate about the evolutionary state of this massive, gas-rich galaxy. Previous authors suggested that a late-stage merger could be the most likely explanation for the morphology and velocity ﬁeld structure in SMM J13120 (Hainline et al. 2006; Engel et al. 2010; Riechers et al. 2011). In the light of our data, we reexamine the evidence supporting this scenario.
---------------------
SMM J13120 shows a complex and discrepant morphology in CO(1-0) and CO(6-5) emission. The CO(10) 0th moment map (Figure 3, top) shows two distinct components separated by ∼11 kpc. The elongated shape of the main component could be indicative of molecular gas being redistributed around a central potential well. The CO(6-5) emission shows ﬂattening almost perpendicular to CO(1-0), indicating a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the distribution of diﬀuse and dense molecular gas.
---------------------
The narrow linewidth seems at odds with other mergers, which report FWHM ∼1000 km s(e.g., Oteo et al. 2016), and might be a priori taken as a signature of a dynamically cold, ordered system. However, the PV diagram (Figure 6) and the resolved velocity maps (Figure 3), as well as the low dynamical mass estimate, indicate that the source is viewed close to face-on. In particular, the 1st moment maps show that the velocity gradient follows the minor axis of CO(1-0) emission. The velocity gradient can also be observed in the PV diagram of the CO(6-5) emission. This kinematic structure in the CO(1-0) emission rules out a circular, regularly rotating disk model for the cold molecular gas reservoir, and lends further support to the merger scenario.
---------------------
These velocity gradients could indicate, however, that the molecular gas, which is at this point mostly concentrated in the main component, is starting to settle into a rotating disc. Simulations have shown that rotating discs of molecular gas can reform on very short timescales after a merger (Robertson et al. 2004; Springel & Hernquist 2005; Robertson et al. 2006; Hopkins et al. 2009). If SMM J13120 is indeed a latestage merger, the process of resettling could have already started. The fact that the velocity gradient is aligned with the minor axis is harder to explain. However, CO(6-5) emission is rotated ∼70with respect to CO(1-0), such that the observed velocity gradient (pictured at 47) more closely corresponds to the major axis of the CO(6-5) emission. This suggests that the disturbed global CO(1-0) morphology may be due to gas that is still being redistributed, which aﬀected the derivation of the major and minor axis beyond what would be expected from a classical disk.
---------------------
Finally, the merger scenario is supported by a comparison between the CO(1-0) and CO(6-5) line emission and near-IR imaging. Figure 9 shows the near-IR HST/ACS F160W (rest-frame λ ∼ 0.4µm) image of SMM J13120. We updated the astrometry of the F160W image by ﬁtting the sources detected in the same ﬁeld with elliptical Gaussians and matching the peak ﬂux positions with those listed in the Hubble Source Catalogue. The CO(6-5) emission is extended on similar scales as CO(10), and the peak emission of both lines is coincident with the stellar emission in SMM J13120. The NW component seen in CO(1-0) is not detected in CO(6-5) and near-IR. The compact stellar distribution (r = 1.3±0.4 kpc, Swinbank et al. 2010) suggests that the merger is in a late stage.
---------------------
In addition to its large submillimiter ﬂux and extended cold gas reservoir, SMM J13120 shows emission lines in the optical spectrum indicative of the presence of an AGN (Chapman et al. 2005). This system appears thus to present characteristics of both the SMG and AGN populations. According to the current paradigm of galaxy evolution (Sanders et al. 1988; Hopkins et al. 2008; Stacey et al. 2018), a fraction of the AGN population at high-z is transitioning from merger-driven SMGs to unobscured quasars. This transitioning population would retain high rates of dust-obscured star formation, thus being luminous in the far-infrared to mm regime. SMM J13120 presents all the characteristics expected for this population. It is thus possible that SMM J13120 is currently transitioning between an SMG and unobscured QSO. The low depletion timescale suggests a phase of rapid star formation that will quickly deplete its gas reservoir, leaving the SMG phase and becoming an AGN. Our SED ﬁtting reveals that, with SFR = 948 Myrand M= 6.5×10M, SMM J13120 sits on the massive end of the main sequence at z=3.4 (Speagle et al. 2014). However, the depletion time of 137 Myr is a factor of 2-3 lower than those observed in the

The beam sizes are 0.39” and 0.6” for CO(1-0) and CO(6-5), respectively. The stellar emission is concentrated and its peak is coincident with the CO(1-0) and CO(6-5) emission peaks. CO(6-5) emission is equally extended as CO(1-0), and its semi major axis appears to be almost perpendicular to that of CO(1-0). general SMG population at this redshift (200-300 Myr, Bothwell et al. 2013; Tacconi et al. 2018; Dudzeviˇci¯ut˙e et al. 2020; Birkin et al. 2021). With a gas fraction also four times lower than expected from empirical scaling relations (Tacconi et al. 2018), this main-sequence galaxy presents characteristics typical of starbursts. Elbaz et al. (2018) found four z∼2 Herschel-selected MS galaxies to be starbursts ‘hidden’ in the main sequence, with short depletion times, low gas fractions and a spheroid-like morphology in the H-band, attributes we also ﬁnd in SMM J13120.
---------------------
The case of SMM J13120 therefore raises two important, connected points. First, it reinforces previous ﬁndings that mergers may drive important physical transformations of galaxies without pushing them oﬀ the main sequence, although most of the currently available work has been done on the most massive galaxies of the main sequence (M> 10M; Fensch et al. 2017; Silva et al. 2018; Cibinel et al. 2019; Puglisi et al. 2019; Drew et al. 2020). Second, it demonstrates that the massive end of the main sequence hosts a variety of star formation modes, rather than solely ‘typical star-forming galaxies’ driven by secular evolution.
---------------------
We have presented high-resolution (0.39”) multiconﬁguration VLA observations of the z=3.4 SMG SMM J13120+4242 in the CO(1-0) emission line. We derive a gas mass of M= (13 ± 3) × 10(α/1.0) M. The molecular gas reservoir, imaged on ∼3 kpc scales, extends over >16 kpc, in agreement with previous measurements. The spectral line proﬁle reveals a FWHM of 267 ± 64 km s. The deeper data presented in this study are quantitatively consistent with previous, less sensitive VLA CO(1-0) observations, and rule out the presence of a broader linewidth component which appeared previously at low SNR.
---------------------
We use a virial estimator to estimate a dynamical mass of M= (1.6 ± 0.9) × 10M. This value is lower than the stellar mass derived from SED ﬁtting (6.45 × 10M), highlighting the impact of the non-gravitationally supported motions seen here on the derivation of the dynamical mass estimate. We thus treat it as a lower limit and use it in combination with the stellar mass to put an upper limit on the CO-toHmass conversion factor, α< 1.4 MKkms pc, consistent with a ULIRG-like value and comparable with the values derived for other high-z SMGs.
---------------------
The massive, extended molecular gas reservoir, with >16 kpc diameter, shows a complex velocity ﬁeld with evidence for a velocity gradient. However, the velocity gradient aligns approximately with the minor axis of the CO(1-0) reservoir, precluding the modelling of the velocity ﬁeld as a circular rotating disk. Using previous observations of CO(6-5), we conﬁrm that the observed velocity gradient is seen in both transitions, but appears to align with the major axis of the CO(6-5) emission. This suggests that the perturbed gas may have already started settling into a disk but has not yet circularised. A late-stage intermediate (5:1) merger is the most likely cause for the disturbed morphology, chaotic velocity ﬁeld and intense burst of star formation taking place in SMM J13120.
---------------------
The CO excitation ladder of the system is well ﬁt by a two component ISM model, with a cold, diﬀuse component and a warm, denser component, as is characteristic of the average SMG population. The properties presented in this paper suggest that SMM J13120 could be in a transitioning phase between a merger-driven starburst and an unobscured QSO. Given its low depletion timescale (∼100 Myr), SMM J13120 is expected to quickly deplete its gas reservoir, eventually turning into an unobscured, gas-poor QSO.
---------------------
We highlight the importance of high-resolution, low-J CO studies for characterising the ISM in high-z SMGs. Although resolved imaging of CO(1-0) at high-z requires signiﬁcant time investments, our case study of SMM J13120 demonstrates that CO(1-0) is key to accurately characterise the dynamical state of the cold molecular gas. High-resolution kinematic studies like this one are also crucial to better understand diﬀerences between gas phases of diﬀerent excitation. Future surveys of the CO(1-0) gas in larger samples of SMGs and their high-resolution follow-up will shed light on the typical molecular gas conditions in these sources.
